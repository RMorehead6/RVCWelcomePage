            <p>Welcome to Rock Valley College!  We're excited that you have decided to pursue your educational and career goals with us and we look forward to having you on campus! Our friendly staff will help you be successful in your college career.<br><br>
            As a new student, the transition to college can be overwhelming. College is very different to high school, and it is critical to build a foundation for success during your first year of college. Typically, this means students switch from studying mainly in class to studying both in class and outside of class equally. Homework becomes less important, and tests become a large part of your final grade. Students also must get used to doing online homework through Canvas, an online learning management tool. A disasterous first year can turn a student off of college all together.  Let us help you with the process as you begin your journey here at Rock Valley College.<br><br>
            <strong>Our Mission:</strong> Rock Valley College empowers the community to grow as a society of learners through well-designed educational pathways, leading to further education, rewarding careers, cultural enrichment, and economic-technological development. </p>
